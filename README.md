  
  This repo is for the development of R examples to add to the dash-bootstrap-components documentation.
  

the `/docs/components` has a folder for each component in the dbc documentation.  These folders will
contain a separate file for each code snippet that will show in a tabbed container in the docs.  
These snippets are not complete apps.  

The  `/examples/components` directory has complete working apps that can be run to show all the 
the examples for each component in the dbc documentation.   For example, you can see all the 
`alert` examples by running  `/examples/components/alert_app.R`
